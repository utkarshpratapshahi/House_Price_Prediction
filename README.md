# House_Price_Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict house prices using one basic machine learning algorithm, Linear Regression, and one advanced algorithm, Random Forest. We will also use regression with regularization such as Ridge and Lasso to try to improve our prediction accuracy.

Random Forest was found to be the better model for predicting house prices. It out performed the regession algorithms with performance accuracy of 85% using R-squared metric. The most important predictor was the overall quality of a house, following the size of above ground living area and the total basement square footage.
## Conclusion-
Random Forest is the most accurate model for predicting the house price. It scored an estimated accuracy of 85%, out performing the regression models (linear, ridge, and lasso) by about 2%. Random Forest determined the overall quality of a home is by far the most important predictor. Following are the size of above grade (ground) living area and the size of total basement square footage. Surprisingly, the lot area did not rank as high as I had expected.

Machinel learning is an iterative process. This first round of data exploration and model evaluation served as a good start to quickly gain insights to get a first reasonably good model prototype. There is a lot of structure in this dataset and further work is required to build a high performing prediction model.
